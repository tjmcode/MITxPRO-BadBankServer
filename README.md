# MITxPRO-BadBankServer

A 4th refactoring of the Bad Bank App, moving it to the 3-Tier MERN Architecture.
The Server side is the simplest Express + MongoDB default.


## Description

This will be used for my MIT xPRO Portfolio.
This Bad Bank project is a refactored version of the Bad Bank 'Fire Hydrant' project I did
in the previous MIT 'Digital Transformation' course in December 2021.
It was bascially rewritten from scratch in React Components, Context, and State.
A 3rd refactoring took all possible Components and commonized and simplified them.

This refactoring moved the entire App to the MERN Client-Server Architecture...

<b>This was the process demo'ed by the MITxPRO Course:</b>

STEP 1: Move files into 'public' folder for serving as static files.</br>
STEP 2: Create new NodeJS App to handle the Server Side in the root folder.</br>
STEP 3: Serve all the static files with ExpressJS.</br>
STEP 4: Create Routes in ExpressJS for all React Components.</br>
STEP 5: Update UI to use new functionality from the Server.</br>
STEP 6: Add a Data Store (MongoDB) to the Backend.</br>
STEP 7: Test entire App with HTTP-SERVER and DOCKER Image.</br>
STEP 8: Host the SITE / APP and make public.</br>

I found I could not simply copy a working CRA into a 'public' folder under an Express Server,
this did not work, the React App never started. (Conflicts between the Server's 'public' folder
and the 'public' folder of the CRA project. I found it did work if I 'compiled' the CRA into a 'build'
folder and served that from my Express Server as a 'static public folder'.

<b>So, my process was:</b>

STEP 1:  Clone the MITxPRO-BadBankReact3 App into MITxPRO-BadBankClient.</br>
STEP 1a: Compile the CRA into a deploable 'build' folder' with 'npm run build'.</br>
STEP 2:  Create a new NodeJS App for the Server side: MITxPRO-BadBankServer.</br>
STEP 2a: Copy the MITxPRO-BadBankClient/build into MITxPRO-BadBankServer/public.</br>
STEP 3:  Serve all the static files with ExpressJS.</br>
STEP 4:  Create Routes in ExpressJS for all React Components.</br>
STEP 5:  Update UI to use new functionality from the Server.</br>
STEP 6:  Add a Data Store (MongoDB) to the Backend.</br>
STEP 7:  Test entire App with HTTP-SERVER and DOCKER Image.</br>
STEP 8:  TBD: Host the SITE / APP and make public.</br>
